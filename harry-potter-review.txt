Do not buy this! I recently read that Amazon sells pirated books (because they don't check--they take the money no matter what they sell)-- which means, not only are the prints not authorized--which is a legal issue, but for the consumer experience, it's detrimental as well. This box set is printed on such coarse paper (paper feels like industrial pulp), the ink becomes blurred and hard to read. Worse yet, I gave them to my daughter (who is too young to know about print quality and thus never complained), and she had to squint through volumes of this crappy print that totally ruined her eyesight, before I realized what was going on. Amazon--you need to do better than this!
